Welcome to SDK Innovation's corner on the web.

We're a bit like the A-team. If you can find us, and afford us, we can fix your
problems. The sky is the limit as to what we can achieve with a computer. We
have extensive experience in software development (notice we do not mention
technology as it's irrelevant to us, if you want it written in brail we can do
that too). We also have extensive experience in cyber security (we can't tell
you what we've done as it would expose our customers to huge risk). We are happy
to do Blue, Red or Purple team work.

Given the above mentioned it follows naturally that we're able to work with
software in all states, be it source code or binary. We've done some extensive
reverse engineering when required in the past.

If you have the need for someone who is not your standard run of the mill
developer or security expert, we're what you're looking for.

If you're still reading and want to know more, call Eben Bruyns: 021 801 387 or
email: eben@sdk.co.nz
